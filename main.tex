\maketitle

This document assumes the reader is familiar with the paper \textit{Traveling with a Map: Reducing the Search Space of Link Traversal Queries Using RDF Shapes} (by the same authors) and its terminology.
It extends that work by presenting the time complexity of the algorithm $subsums_{\mathrm{graph star}}$ described in the paper.
Additionally, it introduces the algorithm $subsums_{\mathrm{Q}}$, which performs query-shape subsumption over an entire query, and presents its time complexity as well.
